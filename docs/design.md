# Dotfiles Design Document

## Overview

This repository manages personal dotfiles across multiple machines and operating systems using symlinks, git, and shell-integrated update notifications. The goal is a simple, low-friction setup: clone once, run install, and all config files are live immediately. Updates propagate automatically via a synchronous git fetch (with timeout) and an interactive prompt on shell start.

Supported platforms: macOS and Linux (including WSL).

## Design Decisions

### Symlink-based

Files live in the repository and are symlinked to their expected locations in the home directory. Editing a config file in place immediately changes the repo working tree — no copy or template step is needed. This makes the feedback loop instant and keeps `git diff` always accurate.

### Single file with OS conditionals

Rather than maintaining OS-specific overlay files or separate branches, all platform branching happens inside individual config files using inline conditionals:

```zsh
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]]; then
  # macOS-specific config
fi
```

This keeps related configuration together and avoids the cognitive overhead of tracking which overlay applies where. macOS-only sections (Java/Homebrew JDK) are wrapped in `OSTYPE` guards. Cross-platform sections (Android SDK) use OS-conditional paths with existence checks.

### Symlink everything regardless of installed tools

The install script creates all symlinks unconditionally, even for tools not installed on the current machine. A dangling symlink causes no harm, and the tool works immediately when later installed without re-running the install script. Tool existence checks (e.g., `command -v nvim`) belong inside config files, not in the install script.

### Interactive install with backup

When the install script encounters an existing file at a symlink target, it prompts for confirmation before overwriting. Existing files are backed up with a timestamp suffix before being replaced:

```
~/.zshrc  ->  ~/.zshrc.backup.20260404-153012
```

The timestamp includes hours/minutes/seconds to prevent backup collisions when running `install.sh` multiple times on the same day.

### Synchronous update check with timeout

`git fetch origin` runs synchronously at shell startup with a 3-second timeout using `perl -e 'alarm(3); exec @ARGV'`. This avoids background job notifications (e.g., `[3] 40017`) and shows the update prompt immediately rather than requiring a keypress. The `perl alarm()` approach is portable across all supported platforms (macOS, Linux, WSL, Cygwin) without requiring additional tools like `timeout` or `gtimeout`. If the network is slow, the fetch times out after 3 seconds and the shell starts normally. The update check logic is extracted to `shell/update-check.zsh`.

### Eagerly-loaded nvm

`nvm.sh` is sourced eagerly at shell startup. A lazy-loaded variant was tried previously but had correctness issues (stub functions did not always hand off cleanly to the real `nvm`, and `node`/`npm` PATH resolution diverged from `nvm` state), so the setup was reverted to the standard eager load. The `.zshrc` tries OS-specific locations in order: Homebrew (`/opt/homebrew` → `/usr/local`) on macOS, then `$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh` as a fallback.

This adds ~360ms to cold shell startup. Revisit lazy-loading if startup latency becomes a priority.

### Modular shell config

Heavy or logically distinct sections of `.zshrc` are extracted to separate files under `shell/` and sourced from `.zshrc`. This keeps the main config readable and makes individual features easier to maintain. Current modules:

- `shell/git.zsh` — Git helper functions (tag push/delete, tag sync)
- `shell/sdkman.zsh` — SDKMAN (JVM SDK manager) init, guarded per-machine
- `shell/mise.zsh` — mise (polyglot runtime version manager) init, guarded per-machine
- `shell/update-check.zsh` — Dotfiles update notification
- `shell/plugin-update.zsh` — Throttled background auto-update for the oh-my-zsh framework, theme, and custom plugins
- `shell/fastfetch.zsh` — fastfetch system-info banner on shell startup, guarded per-machine

### Runtime version manager init order

When more than one runtime version manager is installed on the same machine (e.g. `nvm` and `mise`, or `rbenv` and `mise`), each one's activation prepends its shim or bin directory to `PATH`. The one initialized **last** wins, because its entries end up first in the lookup order.

`shell/.zshrc` initializes them in this order:

1. `sdkman` — only manages JVM tooling (`java`, `gradle`, …). No overlap with other managers, so its position does not matter.
2. `rbenv` — prepends `~/.rbenv/shims`.
3. `nvm` — prepends `$NVM_DIR/versions/node/<version>/bin`.
4. `mise` — sourced from the bottom of `.zshrc`, after every other PATH-mutating block (including `$HOME/.local/bin`, OpenClaw completions, and the managers above).

`mise` is intended to be the unified replacement for the older single-language managers, so it must come last on machines where both are still installed: that way `.tool-versions` resolution wins over a stale `nvm`/`rbenv` shim. If `mise` is not installed, `shell/mise.zsh` is a no-op and the older managers continue to work as before.

### Android SDK paths gated per-directory

`ANDROID_HOME` is set unconditionally based on `OSTYPE` (`~/Library/Android/sdk` on macOS, `~/Android/Sdk` elsewhere), then each SDK subdirectory is appended to `PATH` only after `[[ -d ... ]]` confirms it exists. This matters because the SDK layout has shifted over time and not every machine has every subdirectory:

- `platform-tools/` — `adb`, `fastboot`. Always present on a working SDK install.
- `emulator/` — `emulator` CLI. Required for `emulator -list-avds`, headless CI.
- `cmdline-tools/latest/bin` — `sdkmanager`, `avdmanager`. Modern location (Android Studio 2021+). Required by Expo prebuild and `expo run:android` for license acceptance and on-demand package install.
- `tools/`, `tools/bin/` — Legacy SDK Tools (deprecated, 25.3.0+). Kept on PATH only when the directory still exists, for backwards compatibility with older SDK installs.

`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` is exported as a mirror of `ANDROID_HOME` because some Gradle plugins and native modules still read the older variable name despite Google's deprecation. The cost is one extra `export`; the benefit is avoiding silent build failures on the React Native side.

### No package management

This repository manages config files only. Tool installation is intentionally out of scope. Each machine may have a different set of tools installed, and coupling config management to package installation would add complexity without proportional benefit.

### zsh framework bootstrap from .zshrc

There is one deliberate exception to "no package management": the zsh framework that `.zshrc` itself depends on. Unlike optional tools (`nvim`, `mise`, SDKMAN…), the config is *non-functional* without oh-my-zsh — `source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh` errors out and the prompt/theme/plugins never load. So `.zshrc` bootstraps its own hard dependencies on first run, each guarded by an existence check:

1. **oh-my-zsh** — if `$ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh` is missing, run the official unattended installer with `KEEP_ZSHRC=yes` (so it does not replace our symlinked `~/.zshrc`) and `--unattended` (no prompts, no `chsh`, no shell relaunch). Uses `curl`, or `wget` if `curl` isn't installed.
2. **Powerlevel10k theme** — cloned into `$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k` if absent.
3. **Custom plugins** (`zsh-syntax-highlighting`, `zsh-autosuggestions`, `zsh-z`) — cloned into `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/` if absent.

Order matters: the oh-my-zsh guard runs **before** the theme and plugin clones, because those install into `$ZSH/custom` and assume the framework directory already exists. This keeps the boundary clean — `install.sh` installs no tools and only manages config symlinks, while `.zshrc` self-heals the specific dependencies it cannot run without. All three steps are no-ops once installed, so the cost is paid only on a fresh machine.

### Third-party plugin auto-update

The bootstrap above is install-if-missing only: once a repo exists it is never touched again. Over time the pinned clones drift years behind upstream — a 2021-era Powerlevel10k, for instance, does not recognize newer prompt modes (`nerdfont-v3`) and silently falls back to ASCII icons (the Apple logo rendered as the literal text `OSX`). `shell/plugin-update.zsh` closes the gap without reintroducing per-startup latency.

Design choices:

- **Throttled, not per-startup.** A timestamp file (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/zsh-plugin-update-check`) gates the check to once every `ZSH_PLUGIN_UPDATE_DAYS` days (default 7). The stamp is touched *before* the work runs, so a flaky network does not cause a retry on every shell.
- **Backgrounded.** The fetch/reset runs in a detached subshell, so startup stays instant; updates apply on the next launch. This differs from `update-check.zsh`, which is synchronous and interactive — appropriate there because the dotfiles repo update needs a user decision, whereas third-party fast-forwards need none.
- **`reset --hard FETCH_HEAD` after a `--depth=1` fetch.** Reliable for both shallow and full clones (shallow history is not a known ancestor of the remote, so `merge --ff-only` can refuse). Repos with uncommitted local changes are skipped via `git status --porcelain`, so the reset never clobbers hand edits.
- **Opt-out.** `ZSH_PLUGIN_UPDATE_DAYS=0` disables the check entirely.

The managed set mirrors the bootstrap list: the oh-my-zsh framework, the Powerlevel10k theme, and the three custom plugins.

### Powerlevel10k config as fallback only

`p10k configure` generates machine-specific output based on terminal capabilities (fonts, unicode, colors). Rather than symlinking a shared config, the dotfiles repo stores a default at `shell/p10k.default.zsh`. The `.zshrc` loads `~/.p10k.zsh` if it exists (machine-local), otherwise falls back to the dotfiles default. This means new machines get a working prompt immediately, while existing machines keep their own configuration untouched.

A consequence of this layout: when `~/.p10k.zsh` is absent and the user runs `p10k configure`, the wizard discovers the only existing source path (`shell/p10k.default.zsh`) and writes there directly, dirtying the repo. The README documents the recovery; the trade-off is accepted because the alternative — never bundling a fallback — would degrade the new-machine experience.

### Git config partially excluded

`~/.gitconfig` is not managed by this repository because it typically contains machine-specific values such as credential helpers and user identity. Only `~/.config/git/ignore` (the global gitignore) is managed, as it contains patterns that apply universally.

### Ghostty config shared via a single XDG symlink

Ghostty reads `~/.config/ghostty/config` on both macOS and Linux (macOS additionally checks `~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config`, but the XDG path takes precedence and is honored everywhere). Because the same path works on every supported platform, the config is symlinked directly like the other `~/.config/` tools — no per-machine fallback is needed, unlike Powerlevel10k.

The config intentionally mirrors `config/kitty` (Dracula theme, MesloLGS NF font, 0.80 opacity, 4px padding, block cursor, copy-on-select) so the two terminals look and behave identically. Dracula is referenced as a built-in Ghostty theme rather than vendored, since Ghostty ships the iTerm2 color-scheme collection. One deliberate non-default: `copy-on-select = clipboard` (not the `true`/`primary` default) so selections reach the system clipboard and `ctrl+v` pastes them, matching kitty's `copy_on_select yes` across both Linux and macOS.

Both terminals use **MesloLGS NF**, the font powerlevel10k recommends and installs via `p10k configure`. It is single-width, which `shell/p10k.default.zsh` requires: that config sets `POWERLEVEL9K_ICON_PADDING=none`, so prompt icons must occupy exactly one cell or they overlap adjacent text. The font itself is not vendored in this repo (the repo manages config only — see "No package management"); each machine installs it via `p10k configure` or by dropping the four `MesloLGS NF *.ttf` files into its font directory.

### fastfetch system-info banner on shell startup

`shell/fastfetch.zsh` prints a system summary every time an interactive terminal opens. Like the other optional tools, it is a no-op on machines where the tool is absent — three cheapest-first guards must all pass before fastfetch runs: `[[ -o interactive ]]` (skip scripts and `zsh -c`), `[[ -t 1 ]]` (skip when stdout is captured or piped, so it never pollutes command substitution), and `command -v fastfetch` (skip when not installed). The binary is named `fastfetch` on every supported platform, so a single guarded call covers all of them with no OS conditionals.

Installation, however, is not uniform — per the official docs (`github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch`) fastfetch is not yet in most stable distro repositories. macOS uses Homebrew and Fedora's `dnf` carries it, but Ubuntu only ships it from 25.04 onward (Debian from 13); older Ubuntu — including the typical WSL image — needs the `ppa:zhangsongcui3371/fastfetch` PPA or a `.deb` from GitHub releases, and Cygwin has no package at all, so it relies on the native Windows build installed via `winget` (or `scoop`/`choco`). Because tool installation is out of scope here (see "No package management"), the guard simply makes the banner a no-op wherever fastfetch has not been installed; the per-platform commands live in the header of `shell/fastfetch.zsh`.

The banner uses fastfetch's bundled `archey.jsonc` preset rather than a vendored config. Referencing the preset by name keeps the repo free of a fastfetch config to maintain, and because fastfetch resolves a bare name through its config dir before its built-in presets, a machine that wants something different can still drop its own `archey.jsonc` into `~/.config/fastfetch/` to override — the same machine-local-overrides-default pattern used for Powerlevel10k.

It is sourced near the bottom of `.zshrc`: **after** `shell/update-check.zsh`, so the update check's synchronous (up to 3s) `git fetch` completes before the banner is drawn rather than freezing the screen below it, and **before** `shell/mise.zsh`, so the banner paints right above the prompt while mise keeps its required last-on-PATH position (the banner is display-only and touches no PATH).

## Symlink Mapping

| Repo Path | Target | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `shell/.zshrc` | `~/.zshrc` | file |
| `vim/.vimrc` | `~/.vimrc` | file |
| `config/nvim` | `~/.config/nvim` | directory |
| `config/zellij` | `~/.config/zellij` | directory |
| `config/kitty` | `~/.config/kitty` | directory |
| `config/ghostty` | `~/.config/ghostty` | directory |
| `config/git` | `~/.config/git` | directory |

Directory symlinks are used for tool configs under `~/.config/` to keep the symlink count manageable and to ensure new files added inside those directories are automatically tracked without updating the install script.

---

## Update Notification Flow

1. Shell starts. `git fetch origin` runs synchronously with a 3-second timeout.
2. Local HEAD is compared against remote HEAD.
3. If local is behind remote, the shell prints a notification and prompts:
   ```
   Updates available. Apply now? [Y/n]:
   ```
4. Enter or `y`: runs `dotfiles sync`, which pulls the latest commits and re-runs `install.sh` to apply any new symlinks.
5. `n`: skips the update.

### CLI Safety Guards

- `dotfiles sync` checks for uncommitted changes before running `git pull --rebase`. If the working tree is dirty, it aborts with a warning.
- `dotfiles push` shows pending changes and asks for confirmation before staging with `git add -A`. This prevents accidentally committing unintended files.

---

## Future Considerations

- **Common git config**: Add `~/.config/git/config` to the repo for shared settings such as `user.name`, commit signing preferences, and aliases. Machine-specific values (credential helpers, `user.email`) would remain in the unmanaged `~/.gitconfig`.
- **Package list management**: Optionally track a Homebrew `Brewfile` or apt package list for reproducible machine setup, separate from the dotfiles install flow.
- **Machine-specific overrides**: A sourced local config file (e.g., `~/.zshrc.local`, gitignored) could provide per-machine overrides without requiring repo changes.
- **Secret management**: Sensitive values could be handled via encrypted files (e.g., git-crypt) or a separate private repository, keeping this repo fully public-safe.
